# Sales Prediction
Sales Prediction using Logistics Regression.
Led a project on sales prediction using Python's machine learning, specifically emphasizing Logistic Regression. Conducted a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data better. Analyzed and interpreted data, optimizing advertising strategies by forecasting product demand based on factors like ad expenditure and audience segmentation. Expertly visualized target variable correlations with other features, providing crucial insights into data dynamics.
This model will contribute to informed decision-making, maximizing sales potential for businesses.
